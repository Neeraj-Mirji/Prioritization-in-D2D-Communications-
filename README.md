# Prioritization-in-D2D-Communications-
Many disasters and natural calamities are occurring these days, and their frequency is growing at an alarming rate. Many people perish in these disasters because they are unaware of the natural calamities until it is too late. As a result, it is critical to provide high-performance and accurate communications to first responders during such incidents in order to enhance their teamwork skills and knowledge of the immediate environment, as well as to enable them to quickly send and receive warnings on potentially hazardous circumstances or emergencies. As a result, D2D communication was implemented to speed up public safety communications. However, D2D communication is now used for a variety of other purposes. As a result, the base station must first determine the intent before allocating resources to each D2D pair, which takes time and thus slows down the communication process. So here we have come up with a novel idea that felicitates the public safety communications and the same we have implemented with the help of Network simulator 3. We have basically grouped all D2D users carrying out a public safety communication under a group and rest others into the other group using k -means algorithm. Therefore if a public safety communication is going on the eNB can easily come to know at the earliest and can give more reference to those communications by allotting best possible resources to carry out such communications


## Following are the Objectives of the Project
The objectives of this project are mentioned below:
• To group d2d devices based on their application
• Create clusters in each group using k means.
• Provide more resources to D2D users carrying out public
safety communications .
• To calculate the SINR values of the UE devices in the
newly created shards
• To calculate throughput and end to end delay for public
safety shard and social media shard.
